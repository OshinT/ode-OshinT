This is your repository for submitting your coursework, which should
be a report in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.

You should also upload (by commiting and pushing using Git commands)
any code that is required to replicate your results, along with any
images or other files used in your report.

A key principle of academic studies is that all work should be
reproducible in order that other researchers can validate and
scrutinise your results.  You should ensure that the code is entirely
your work and that there is sufficient detail in the report to be able
to reproduce the figures, tables or other data that you present.
